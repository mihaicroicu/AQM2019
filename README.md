 <sub><sup> If you stumbled upon this place by accident, this is the Advanced Quantitative Methods class of 2019 at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University, Sweden. The course is given by Prof. Håvard Hegre, Mihai Croicu and David Randahl. We cover data management, basics of programming (in R), Monte-Carlo Methods and simulation studies, basics of machine-learning (out of sample partitioing and crossvalidation, performance metrics...), Generalized Linear Models (OLS, Logit, Count...) spanning the inferential, simulation and forecasting paradigms. We will also introduce multi-level modelling and end with decomposition machine-learning methods (trees and random forests). This is the most advanced course offered at the M.A./M.Sc. level in the department, and is open to doctoral students. You are of course free to take a look - and if you want to register, visit UUs page (fees may apply and do note this is a campus course with 100% attendance) : http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/exchange/courses/list/course-description/?kKod=2FK055&typ=1  <sub><sup>
